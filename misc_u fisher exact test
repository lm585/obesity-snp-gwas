# FISHER EXACT TEST in R
#
# Example data:
# Area     With rabies      Without rabies
# ----     -----------      --------------
#  E          16                11 
#  W           6                17
# Read the 2x2 contingency table, r=2 rows (X values), c=2 columns (Y values):
data<-scan()
  16      11
   6      17

tab <- t(matrix(data, nrow=2,ncol=2))  # transpose, as usual
tab         # view the table to make sure it is right
	[,1] [,2]
   [1,]   16   11
   [2,]    6   17
   
fisher.test(tab)   # performs a test of independence for matrix input.

	   Fisher's Exact Test for Count Data

   data:  tab
   p-value = 0.02437

# ==> REJECT the null hypothesis that X,Y (area,rabies) are independent at
#     the 0.05 level,  namely that the odds of finding rabies is the same in
#     area E and in area W. 

   alternative hypothesis: true odds ratio is not equal to 1
   95 percent confidence interval:
     1.072816 16.715195
   sample estimates:
   odds ratio
     3.998220

# Conclude that the odds of rabies in E is about 4 times the odds of rabies
#  in area W.
